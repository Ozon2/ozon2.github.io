With net7 we participated to the fourth edition of the Toulouse Hacking Convention taking place at ENSEEIHT on March 6th. It is a day of conferences focusing on cybersecurity. I helped to install everything before the event. During the event I volunteered to welcome people at the entrance in the morning and I was responsible for the broadcast of the event on youtube in the afternoon.
