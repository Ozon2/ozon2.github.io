## Strengths

My personal strengths generally involve my ability to learn new skills. I am willing to put in time and effort to learn new skills, and most of the time I can learn them quickly. During my civic engagement, I was working with the net7 team (the computer club of ENSEEIHT) and I had to learn new skills by myself. For instance, to be able to to work on the studentsâ€™ website and improve it, I had to learn new web programming languages such as Django and I also had to quickly understand how to work with a database. I always enjoy learning new skills by myself because I can choose to work on a topic I particularly like.

Others often describe me as patient and careful. When confronted to a problem, I always take the time needed to to think of all the solutions and outcomes possible, I always avoid taking hasty decisions.

I am also very curious. I have always wanted to know and understand everything. For instance, I like to deepen my understanding on the functioning of new technologies, it allows me to acquire useful knowledge in many fields.

Moreover, I believe that I am productive and organized, I have a clear understanding of my priorities, and I use my time to maximize my output. During the civic engagement project, I always tried to set clear targets with precise roadmaps and milestones, which allowed everyone in the group to be more efficient.

## Weaknesses

My Communication skills are weak. I am an introvert and I am not good at communicating with people I have never met. I often prefer working alone, as team work can be difficult for me. However this was not really a problem for our civic engagement project as I already knew most people in the group so I felt integrated from the beginning.

I have no employment experience, which makes it a lot harder to find an internship in a domain I like.
On top of that I can get stressed easily, it is very difficult for me te speak in public because of that. I am also especially anxious during job interviews, which can reduce my chances of getting a job.

## Conclusion

Improving upon my weaknesses is very important for me. To improve my communication skills, I can practice more with my friends and ask them for feedback. I also believe I can learn to cope with my stress by trying to clear my mind before a stressful situation, that way I can tackle the situation with a clear head.
