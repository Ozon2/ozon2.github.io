I volunteered at Capitole du Libre, a weekend long event dedicated to open source software. The event hosted 100 lectures and 25 workshops for the general public and experts. I helped to install the equipment before the event, and during the weekend, I volunteered at the install party where I helped people install Linux operating systems on their machines. But sometimes, the issues were complex so we worked together, each volunteer bringing his experience in order to fix the issue. We all had the oportunity to put our knowledge into pratice to help people.
