In an everchanging digital world, we seek to help people around us with the help of new technology. Therefore, we started with the people around us: students at the Toulouse INP. We strongly believe today's technology can have a great impact, and that they should be used in order to improve people's lives. As such, we want to promote this technology in a sustainable fashion, while helping each other to reduce our impact on the planet. This is also an opportunity for educating people and proving altogether that solutions exist and are easy to use.
