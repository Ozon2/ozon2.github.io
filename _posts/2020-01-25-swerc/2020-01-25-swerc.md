SWERC is a 5-hour on-site programming contest for teams of three students, focused on algorithmic problem solving and practical coding. SWERC serves as the regional selection phase for the International Collegiate Programming Contest.

After 2 months of preparation, we arrived in Paris to compete with 100 teams coming from all Europe to solve complex algorithmic problems. The problems were really interesting and challenging. The level of this contest is very high and some students are able to solve much more problems than us during the competition.

Yet we still managed a good score (<sup>56</sup>&frasl;<sub>95</sub> teams) for a first time participation. It was also an oportunity to talk with computer science students from foreign countries about their education and training.
