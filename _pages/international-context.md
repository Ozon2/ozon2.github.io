# International context

## Working at Bleemeo

I have been working at [Bleemeo](https://bleemeo.com/) since June 2021, first
for the internship at the end of my second year at ENSEEIHT, and now as an
employee during my “contrat de professionnalisation”.

Bleemeo sells a cloud monitoring solution that allows companies to quickly have
a look at the status of their servers and applications. The customers have to
install an agent on each of their servers they want to monitor, it automatically
detects applications running on the servers and sends metrics back to the
Bleemeo API. Users can access a web dashboard that contains graphs to show the
current status of their applications and servers.

I work as a developer on the monitoring agent and several other projects which
require a high level of English as I have to write code and comments in English.
Moreover, tracking issues and new features for our product as well as writing
documentation is done in English.

Bleemeo has international customers. I had the opportunity to do online meetings
in English with some of them to discuss their needs and problems.
