# Civic Engagement

I am the vice-president of net7, the computer club of ENSEEIHT. We provide services to the students of the school, 
we fix computers and we organize training courses in computer science. We also participate to some events to 
promote free software and cybersecurity. You can learn more about my engagement at net7 [here](/net7/).

I also [volunteered at the Capitole du Libre](/capitole-du-libre/) and [participated to the Toulouse Hacking
Convention](/thc).

# Problem solving

I participated to SWERC, a programming contest for teams of three students, focused on algorithmic problem solving 
and practical coding, learn more [here](/swerc/).
