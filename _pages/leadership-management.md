# Leadership and management

## Writing my personal SWOT analysis

<img src="/assets/img/swot-illustration.png" width="50%">

SWOT stands for "strength, weakness, opportunity and threat" analysis. In first year we were asked to write
our own SWOT analysis, but only focusing on our strengths and weaknesses. You can find it [here](/swot/).

## Civic Engagement

I am the vice-president of net7, the computer club of ENSEEIHT. We provide services to the students of the school, 
we fix computers and we organize training courses in computer science. We also participate to some events to 
promote free software and cybersecurity. You can learn more about my engagement at net7 [here](/civic-engagement).

I also [volunteered at the Capitole du Libre](/capitole-du-libre) and [participated to the Toulouse Hacking
Convention](/thc).
