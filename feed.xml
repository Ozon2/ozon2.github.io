&lt;p&gt;This year I wanted to find the right internship to improve my technical skills in software development with either Python or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very lucky to find an internship at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laas.fr/public/en&quot;&gt;LAAS&lt;/a&gt;, a research unit of the CNRS. I was given three small projects during the two months I worked there, and I dedicated approximately three weeks to each of them. Sadly, I was only able to work remotely because of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-work-at-laas&quot;&gt;My work at LAAS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;educational-robots&quot;&gt;Educational robots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thymio.org/&quot;&gt;Thymio&lt;/a&gt; is an educational robot created for teachers and students from primary school to university, it allows students to discover the universe of robotics and learn a robot’s language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first project I had to create a work environment on a Rasberry Pi so students could program Thymio robots easily. The goal was also to make it easy for teachers to monitor their student’s computers. I also made a game to allow teams of students to compete in a Thymio race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project allowed me to learn &lt;strong&gt;cross-compilation&lt;/strong&gt; and to discover software development with &lt;strong&gt;Qt&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; to make a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dashboard&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finished my first project I was then charged to work on the lab’s dashboard, a Django app which essentially centralizes projects from both Gitlab and Github, CI results and other useful information about all the activities done at LAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem I had to solve was that the repositories were hosted on Github but the CI had to be done on Gitlab, so I was tasked to mirror every commit on Github to Gitlab, let the CI run on Gitlab and get the CI status back to Github. I also had to synchronize issues on both repositories and display them on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was challenging because I didn’t work with &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt; before, but I really enjoyed learning it. It also made me discover working with REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;python-packages&quot;&gt;Python packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After theses projects I still had some time left, so I was given a third project. I was tasked to package some Python apps so they could be published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org&quot;&gt;PyPi&lt;/a&gt;. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/manylinux&quot;&gt;manylinux&lt;/a&gt; to produce packages that are compatible with the vast majority of desktop and server Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this project because it made me work with &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked this internship, it was my first work experience and it made me confident that I chose the right path for my career. I enjoy software development and system administration and I hope I will find work in this field after my studies. The only downside of this internship is that I wish I was able to work at LAAS because always working remotely can be a little depressing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My personal SWOT analysis</title><link href="https://tom.pillot.dev/swot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My personal SWOT analysis" /><published>2020-04-03T19:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-04-03T19:20:00+02:00</updated><id>https://tom.pillot.dev/swot</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tom.pillot.dev/swot/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/swot/swot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strengths&quot;&gt;Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal strengths generally involve my ability to learn new skills. I am willing to put in time and effort to learn new skills, and most of the time I can learn them quickly. During my civic engagement, I was working with the net7 team (the computer club of ENSEEIHT) and I had to learn new skills by myself. For instance, to be able to to work on the students’ website and improve it, I had to learn new web programming languages such as Django and I also had to quickly understand how to work with a database. I always enjoy learning new skills by myself because I can choose to work on a topic I particularly like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others often describe me as patient and careful. When confronted to a problem, I always take the time needed to to think of all the solutions and outcomes possible, I always avoid taking hasty decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also very curious. I have always wanted to know and understand everything. For instance, I like to deepen my understanding on the functioning of new technologies, it allows me to acquire useful knowledge in many fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I believe that I am productive and organized, I have a clear understanding of my priorities, and I use my time to maximize my output. During the civic engagement project, I always tried to set clear targets with precise roadmaps and milestones, which allowed everyone in the group to be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weaknesses&quot;&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Communication skills are weak. I am an introvert and I am not good at communicating with people I have never met. I often prefer working alone, as team work can be difficult for me. However this was not really a problem for our civic engagement project as I already knew most people in the group so I felt integrated from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no employment experience, which makes it a lot harder to find an internship in a domain I like.
On top of that I can get stressed easily, it is very difficult for me te speak in public because of that. I am also especially anxious during job interviews, which can reduce my chances of getting a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving upon my weaknesses is very important for me. To improve my communication skills, I can practice more with my friends and ask them for feedback. I also believe I can learn to cope with my stress by trying to clear my mind before a stressful situation, that way I can tackle the situation with a clear head.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><category term="leadership and management" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My civic engagement at N7</title><link href="https://tom.pillot.dev/net7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My civic engagement at N7" /><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-03-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://tom.pillot.dev/net7</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tom.pillot.dev/net7/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/net7/poster-net7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an everchanging digital world, we seek to help people around us with the help of new technology. Therefore, we started with the people around us: students at the Toulouse INP. We strongly believe today’s technology can have a great impact, and that they should be used in order to improve people’s lives. As such, we want to promote this technology in a sustainable fashion, while helping each other to reduce our impact on the planet. This is also an opportunity for educating people and proving altogether that solutions exist and are easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><category term="leadership and management" /><category term="civic engagement" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Volunteering at the Toulouse Hacking Convention</title><link href="https://tom.pillot.dev/thc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Volunteering at the Toulouse Hacking Convention" /><published>2020-03-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-03-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://tom.pillot.dev/thc</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tom.pillot.dev/thc/">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With net7 we participated to the fourth edition of the Toulouse Hacking Convention taking place at ENSEEIHT on March 6th. It is a day of conferences focusing on cybersecurity. I helped to install everything before the event. During the event I volunteered to welcome people at the entrance in the morning and I was responsible for the broadcast of the event on youtube in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><category term="leadership and management" /><category term="civic engagement" /><summary type="html">The team of volunteers at the Toulouse Hacking Convention</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Participating to the SWERC competition</title><link href="https://tom.pillot.dev/swerc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Participating to the SWERC competition" /><published>2020-01-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-01-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://tom.pillot.dev/swerc</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tom.pillot.dev/swerc/">&lt;p&gt;SWERC is a 5-hour on-site programming contest for teams of three students, focused on algorithmic problem solving and practical coding.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 months of preparation, we arrived in Paris to compete with 100 teams coming from all Europe to solve complex algorithmic problems. The problems were really interesting and challenging. The level of this contest is very high and some students are able to solve much more problems than us during the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet we still managed a good score (&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; teams) for a first time participation. It was also an oportunity to talk with computer science students from foreign countries about their education and training.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><category term="leadership and management" /><category term="civic engagement" /><summary type="html">SWERC is a 5-hour on-site programming contest for teams of three students, focused on algorithmic problem solving and practical coding.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I volunteered at Capitole du Libre, a weekend long event dedicated to open source software. The event hosted 100 lectures and 25 workshops for the general public and experts. I helped to install the equipment before the event, and during the weekend, I volunteered at the install party where I helped people install Linux operating systems on their machines. But sometimes, the issues were complex so we worked together, each volunteer bringing his experience in order to fix the issue. We all had the oportunity to put our knowledge into pratice to help people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Pillot</name></author><category term="leadership and management" /><category term="civic engagement" /><summary type="html">The team of volunteers at the Capitole du Libre</summary></entry></feed>
